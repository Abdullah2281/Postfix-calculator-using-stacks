# Postfix Calculator using Stacks

This project implements a postfix calculator using stacks. The postfix notation, also known as the Reverse Polish Notation (RPN), is a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. 

## How it Works

1. **Postfix Conversion**: The input infix expression is first converted to a postfix expression.
2. **Evaluation**: The postfix expression is then evaluated using stacks to produce the result.

## How to Test

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system, such as `g++`.

### Testing Steps

1. **Setup**:
    - Place all the `.cpp` files and the files in the tester(debug_testcase, main.cpp) in one directory.

2. **Compilation**:
    - Navigate to the directory containing the `.cpp` files using the terminal.
    - Use the following command to compile:
      ```bash
      g++ *.cpp
      ```
      This will generate an executable named `a.exe` (on Windows).

3. **Run the Test**:
    - Execute the compiled program using the command:
      ```bash
      ./a.out
      ```
      This will run all the test cases and display the results, indicating whether the code is functioning correctly.
